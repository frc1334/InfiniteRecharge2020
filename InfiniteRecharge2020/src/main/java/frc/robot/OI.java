Operator Interface (OI) Class

The Operator Interface (aka OI) class links the Driver and Operator (WPILIB Controllers Classes)
actions (e.g., button pressing, triggers, joysticks) and calls appropriate PID-based
Commands.

The OI class also provides methods that allow Commands (without PID) to access
controller data (e.g., DriveSubsystem drive operations)
